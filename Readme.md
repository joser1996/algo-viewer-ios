# About
Decided to build an application that would let me visualize different type of
sorting algorithms. Also intend to add visualization for graph algorithms, such
as BFS and DFS in the future. 

I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to become more familiar with SwiftUI
as I have experience with UIKit only.
